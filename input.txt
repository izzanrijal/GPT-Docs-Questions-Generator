[SOUND] [LAUGH] Oh, yeah. Sounds like you had a crazy weekend. Well, looks like my friends are here. I gotta get going. Bye. See you later.
Hello, and welcome to an Introduction to Game Design. My name is Fran Krause. I'm a professor at the California Institute of the Arts. In this course, we'll be game designers. We'll be talking about the structures and mechanics behind your favorite games. What makes them work? What makes them fun? How they can tell stories, and how they can be improved.
We'll also be making our own games, trying them out, and making them better. Don't worry if you're not experienced in computer programming. This course doesn't require any specialized programs or equipment. All our assignments can be done with a pencil and paper. This is because we're gonna be focusing on the creative decisions a game designer makes. While they're making a game. After all, these creative decisions, like who is your hero, what's their quest? What challenges will they meet along the way?
These are the questions, which, when answered creatively. Can make your game fun and allow you to connect with your players. This course is the first in a four course series about video games that we're making here at CalArts. We'll be focusing on the elements of game design in this course. And in others, we'll be learning about world design, character design and storytelling. The goal of all four classes is to help you make a game design document. A text that you can use to describe your game to yourself and the world. I have to admit, this is my first time recording an online class. And I'm a little bit nervous about talking to a camera. I'm used to teaching with all my students around. So, luckily an old friend of mine has volunteered to stand by the camera. And give me a little encouragement. Thanks Buddy. >> No problem Fran. >> Great so let's make some games.

Hey, check out this cool game I just downloaded! It's pretty high tech. I'm gonna give it a try. [NOISE] Yes. I scored a point. Finally. So, why am I showing you a game that's this low tech in a class about video games? Well, you're gonna be hearing this from me a lot over the next four weeks, but keeping things simple is very important. In this case, the simplicity of this game helps us pick it apart and talk about how it works. It's a game that has been around for hundreds of years, so it must be doing something right. I also want to talk about this game because even though it's simple it has many of the things we'll find in a good video game. [MUSIC] Goal. First off, this game has a clear goal. By looking at the game, it's pretty easy to figure out the object of this game without reading the instructions. It also has a few different goals to keep things interesting. There are three different cups and a spike that can be used to catch the ball, so if I get enough practice to where the big cup isn't challenging, I can try something more difficult. This is something you'll see in many popular games. There's increasing levels of difficulty. Speaking of difficulty, it's pretty hard to get the ball to land in the cup. Now there are easier ways to complete our goal, like I could just do that. But part of this game's design is to add difficulty to our goal. All games do this. In fact, the main purpose of most game design, is to take our goal, let's say finding a doorway, and design it to be difficult to reach, maybe by hiding that doorway at the far end of a monster infested maze, under water. >> Oh, let's make it magically invisible. >> Yeah, that would be a challenge. [MUSIC] Chance and Skill. Two elements that affect a game's difficulty are chance and skill. You may have heard of games of chance, and games of skill. Game of chance would be something like roulette or the lottery. In these games, victory is random. Playing the lottery every single day, doesn't make you better at playing the lottery. Practice doesn't help your odds. A game of skill would be something like chess or checkers. There are no dice rolls or anything that adds randomness to the game. Victory is based on the choices made by the players. And the players' skill has a lot to do with their chance of winning. Playing chess every day, would help improve a player's skills. It would help their odds of winning the game. As I'm playing this game, there's some chance involved in the way the ball moves. Each time I play the ball's path is a little different. And that makes the game a little different each time I play. This variation keeps the game interesting. This game also uses skill. As I practice, I can get better at the game. Maybe try out different techniques and approaches. You'll see a mix of chance and skill in a lot of games. For instance, most card games create chance by shuffling the deck each time. But they require skill in the way a player chooses to play their cards. In a game like Tetris, you have some chance as the computer chooses all the falling pieces. But fitting the pieces together requires skill and forces a player to think and to practice.

I wanna talk to you a bit about a tool that we'll be hearing about from time to time in this class. A game design document. It's a document that a game designer puts together as they're creating a game. The format of the game design document varies depending on who puts it together, or what type of game they're designing, or who the designer is working with. There are a few things that show up in most game design documents. There is a description of the game, there is also usually a description of the game play involved, the game's goals, puzzles and characters may be described, there might be illustrations, maps and story lines. Some of the document might include technical writing about different programming techniques involved with the game's production.
Basically, the game design document is a book that clarifies how the game works. The game design document is an important tool, because in a modern game company there may be hundreds of people all working on the same game. A game design document helps keep everyone on the same page. It's something that anyone can refer to if they have questions about the game. It's also frequently updated and revised during production, since the game might have small or large changes over the course of writing, programming, play testing and any other step of the process. As a lone game designer, a game design document is also very important. It's a place where someone can gather their ideas. In the early stages, it can almost be a scrapbook of thoughts as a designer figures out what their game is all about. Even though they might not have to communicate with a big company, a game design document can help the lone game designer communicate with themselves. It can remind them of their initial concepts and it can keep them on a steady path. There's a lot that can go into a game design document, and there's a lot of variety between game design documents for different games. In this course, we'll be working on skills that will help us make our game design documents richer, more creative, and more fun.

So in this class, we'll be making a series of games on paper. These will let us try out some of our gaming concepts and will allow us to focus on game design without worrying about computers or coding. To help get us started, I made my first game, and I have to say, I think you're gonna be pretty impressed, here it is. It’s a straight line. You start at the bottom. And every turn, you move one space closer to the top, where the game ends. >> Your game looks lousy, Fran. >> What? >> I said your game.
Looks lousy. >> Well, my friend’s comment brings us to our next topic. [SOUND] Feedback. We'll be making these projects by ourselves, and then uploading and sharing them with our classmates for feedback. That makes feedback very important for this class, as it's the method we have for evaluating and learning with each other. Now, when my friend said that my games was lousy, that didn't really tell me much about my game. It doesn't sound like my games successful it sounds like there are some problems with its design however his comment doesn't really help me to find those problems in my game. His comment also doesn't help him much as its not really getting him to think constructively or creatively about gaming. Could you try another comment? But this time, I’d like you to say why you think my game’s lousy. >> Your game looks lousy because it’s so boring!
>> That’s much more useful. Now I know that the problem with my game is that it’s boring. With that information, I can try to change it so that it’s more interesting. We'd spoken earlier about goals in gaming, so maybe I can change my game so that it starts with an explorer landing in a strange forest, and at the end, there's a lost cave filled with treasure. That would be a more interesting goal. We also talked about chance and skill in gaming, and how some difficulty can make a game more interesting. Well, I could add some change with a roll of dice. Instead of my player moving just one space every turn, they could roll a die and move between one and six spaces each turn. If I wanted to add some skill, I could change that path of my game into a maze. There, I think my game's looking more interesting. Now what do you think of my game? >> Your game looks less lousy than before. >> One more thing about feedback. We need to stay polite and civil. Making comments about other people's work can be really tricky and there's no advantage to either person if a reviewer's comments are seen as mean and unkind. When reviewing someone's project, here's some steps you can follow. Examine the project, think about it and try to figure out how you feel about it, try to figure out why you feel that way, then share your thoughts and your reasoning. With that in mind, what do you think of my game. >> Well I thought it was too simple at first without a goal or any difficulty. But I think it's looking better now. Could use some color though. >> Like this?
>> Woah, yeah, that's much better! >> Thanks. Now, if we all try our best, feedback can be a valuable and enriching part of this course for the reviewer and the game designer being reviewed.

One of the hardest parts of starting to make a game is getting started in the first place. I find that students and designers can waste a lot of time trying to think of a perfect idea that they can use for the basis of their project. So, first off, there are no perfect ideas.
Think of the central ideas to some of your favorite games. We have a pizza that eats ghosts, a wagon that shoots buffalo, a plumber that fights mushrooms. These are not perfect ideas, but they are interesting ideas. An interesting idea is a great place to start. It can start your curiosity, and it can inspire questions that your game can help answer. After you decide on an idea, there's usually something that happens shortly afterwards. Your idea starts to look like a bad idea. You'll find problems with it, and maybe you'll start to think it's a silly idea. This is a totally normal part of the process. Digging into a project starts to expose the problems with that idea, but every idea has problems and finding creative solutions to these problems is the way game designer really get to define their projects. Think of Pac-Man! One of the problems that game had was each level was constrained to a one-screen maze. One of the designers might have looked at that and seen that if Pac-Man ran off the left side of the screen they could reappear on the right side of the screen. That's a nice way of expanding the space of the game that might not have happened if the game hadn't had that initial problem. So, how do you come up with an idea in the first place? Here are a few tips.
Relax and remember that this is only a one-week assignment. It's hard to think creatively when you're stressed out. Try brainstorming some lists. You can try to brainstorm some lists of possible characters, or titles, or inspiring words, or professions, anything you think will help get your brain going. It's important that any list you make be as long as possible. You'll want to give yourself plenty of options. I find that the second half of my lists, after I've relaxed and gotten a bit silly, usually are better than the first half when I'm still worried about making a good idea. Try a theme. For instance, I find that some students find it easier if I give them a general theme to start with. Something vague but clear enough that it still narrows down the choices a little bit. For instance, you could make your game about travel or your first day at a new job or a ghost story. If you're stuck ask a friend for some suggestions. Hey, can you give me some suggestions? >> How about a game about a puppet in a film studio. Who needs to think of ideas? >> Those are some interesting ideas, but it sounds like you might think of some better ideas if we got out of the studio for a little bit. We could seek some outside inspiration. Maybe we could find some books or art or movies that can get us some ideas that are new to us, rather than things that we're familiar with. So those are some initial tips to getting us started and finding some new ideas.
Finding ideas can be really tricky, but remember that it's all part of the process. And when you're brainstorming a list of possible ideas, only one has to be the right one.

So this week, our assignment will be to make a simple game on paper. There are only a few requirements. The game should all fit on one piece of paper. The game should be a one player game. A short description and instructions for your game should be at the top of the page. The only extra thing anyone should need to play are two six-sided dice. If you don't have dice, there are websites that can simulate dice rolls. Even though there are a lot of limitations with this assignment, there's also a lot you can do inside those limitations. Here's some ideas. The game space can be any shape or design so long as it fits on a sheet of paper. You might have a player moving along a straight path or a winding path, or a straight path with branches, or a winding path with branches. Or a maze or a grid or any design that will fit on the page so long as it makes sense in the context of your game. The spaces on your game board can say anything or at least anything that will fit into that small space. A space might change your characters goal or the number of dice they roll each turn. Or it might unlock a new part of your board. Oh, yes? >> Oh, can I have a space that makes my player move backwards? >> Sure. >> What didn't you say so in the first place? >> Well, I hadn't thought of that, but it fits in with the assignment and it could be a fun thing to add to your game. I'm not gonna be able to list every possibility. So, I'm leaving certain things open for you all to figure out. >> Well it sounds like you're a lazy teacher Fran. >> Well, maybe. But I think it's important in this class that you learn some things from the course and some things from yourself. And some things from your classmates. You'll get the most out of this class if you're learning something from all three of those sources. The things we went over, whether you're game should be a twisty path or a grid, or a maze, what the spaces on your path should say, that might all sound like a lot to fit on one page and that's true. You won't be able to do that all on one game. One of the reasons we're limiting ourselves to a one page assignment is to keep our game simple and manageable. Your game might only have space for one or two unusual features, and that's fine. It's better for a game to have one or two unusual features that you've had time to develop than to have your game have many features that aren't thought out or are confusing. Yes? >> Do our drawings have to be awesome? Mine are just okay. >> Well, if you're worried about your drawing skills, think of tic-tac-toe. All the drawing elements of that game are usually pretty messy but it's still a very fun and very popular game. For this assignment we're going to be focusing on game play rather than art work. You can always take time to make your game look fancier or more polished but if the game play is boring, that fancy artwork won't matter. As you design your game, remember to test it out. See what it feels like to play the game, maybe even get some friends to try it out. I can't wait to see what you all come up with.

[MUSIC] Welcome back. Last time we met, we talked about the importance of making a design document for your game, a document that collects your thoughts and descriptions of your games, so we can describe it and share it with other people. We also had some homework for the week. We made a simple game just to get us started. We collected our game with a short description and a few instructions, and we shared it with our friends and classmates to get their reactions and their feedback. In putting your game together with a description, you are actually making a simple design document. Remember, from last week? A design document, it has no standard format, but it has a standard purpose. It communicates your game, and your homework did just that. So why when I gave the assignment, did I tell you to make a game and not a design document? Well, I thought if I called it a game, it would be more fun. If I called it a design document, which can some times be these giant books that take tons of time to create, some of you might have been intimated. You might have tried to pack too many things into the assignment, and it might have become something that wasn't possible to make in one week. Calling something a game, and thinking of something as a game keeps it fun. Thinking creatively is much easier when we're at ease and enjoying our time. It's important while we create, that we should be having fun and playing with our ideas. And that's why, in these lectures, sometimes I talk to a puppet. >> I'm a puppet.
>> For this week, we'll be talking about making rules for your game. We'll be looking at some examples of how rules are used in gaming, and we'll try to understand how small changes in your rules can have a big effect on how your players interact with your game.

Let's talk about how a video game's rules can help your game achieve a balance that keeps your players interested and engaged.
Say you're playing a favorite video game, progressing through the levels. You're gaining skills and practicing, finding new tools and power-ups for your character. Your skills are increasing and your character's getting stronger. However, just as your character gets stronger as you move to tougher levels, all the enemies in the game are getting stronger, too. The puzzles are getting harder and the skill required to keep progressing in the game is always increasing. It's like a conspiracy. My power increases throughout the game, my character becomes more powerful, and my skills as a player increase, but just as I do, the game gets more difficult the whole time. It's like the game is trying to maintain a steady difficulty over all of its levels. It's, ow, my brain.
Well, what's going on there is the designers are trying to keep the game challenging. You probably remember a time when you've solved the game, then replayed an earlier level that you once thought was really hard, only to find that the level is now not so much of a challenge. Well, this has happened to most game designers, too. They know that their games need to be challenging enough to keep you interested, but not so challenging that you become disheartened and give up. The game designer tries their best to keep things balanced. Just as the levels get more difficult, your character might discover a new power that will help them overcome these new obstacles. And if that power starts making things too easy, the designer needs to make some obstacles even more difficult. You can see how this becomes a cycle that repeats throughout a lot of games and how that cycle can keep a player interested in gaining a better power in order to solve a new problem, in order to gain an even better power, in order to solve an even tougher obstacle, and so on. Where else can we find balance in the rules of games? Well, a lot of the rules that we see repeated in a lot of games are repeated because there's balance to them, and that keeps things interesting. What's an example of a rule we find in many different video games? Yes? In the front row? >> Oh, lots of games have health and hearts and life energy, stuff like that. >> Right, lots of games have some sort of game mechanic that involves the character's health points or lives. You'll see this in a lot of different games. Now, if a character has a ton of health and they're in great shape, the player might take more risks. Those risks will cause them to lose some of their health, which will make them more cautious and they'll take fewer risks, which will help them maintain their health. There's some balance to that, and it keeps things interesting as a player plays the game one way when their character is healthy and another when their character is unhealthy. You might notice that most of the really good power-ups in video games have at least one big disadvantage. Pac-Man might get a power pellet and be able to eat ghosts, but it only lasts a little while, and there are a limited number of them on each level. Your character might get a rocket launcher in Grand Theft Auto and it might be really powerful, but it turns out the rockets are harder to find and slower than the other weapons. Your character in another game might be a wizard who learns a high-level magic spell that they might need a long time to say all those magic words. These rules, with their trade-offs, help to keep the game challenging. Even though the character might gain more powers, they still need to learn how to use them and work with the quirks and imperfections of those new powers. So keep in mind as you make rules for your games, will they keep the game interesting and challenging for a player? Will they make things too easy or difficult? Will they give your player a new goal to reach for or help create a new challenge? Will they force your players to think of new approaches and techniques for playing? Keeping your game balanced is one of the biggest challenges you have as a game designer, but one that pays off many times over for you and your players.

When we play a board game, one of the first things we do is read the rules. In order to play a board game properly, we need to understand all the rules, and they're usually all available for us at the start of the game. If we didn't know and understand the rules of the game, we wouldn't know if someone was cheating, or even what the goal of the game might be. In video games, it's much different. Most people start playing a game without reading any instructions, and they discover the rules by exploring the game and trying out different actions. They try out things with their character to answer questions like, is this ice thick enough to support my weight? Are these dragons friendly? Can I jump to the other side of that chasm? They don't need to know the rules, because the game acts as a referee. It knows all the rules and makes sure that none of them are broken as the player explores the game's world. For the purpose of this class, a rule is anything that defines what happens in the game and isn't a player's input. There might be a rule that says the character can jump five feet. Another might say, the character cannot walk through walls. That's an obvious rule, but it's one that a designer would need to define. Anything that needs to happen, or needs to not happen, will have to be explained in a rule. And that can be a lot of rules.
Let's go over some rules you might see in a video game. I'll use Pong as an example, since it's a simple game that most of us are familiar with. My friend and I studied Pong for a while and tried to figure out every rule we could think of. It took awhile, and I think we found a bunch. [SOUND] To make things a little simpler, I'm gonna start off with a few rules that define the world where Pong happens. And after that, we'll go over the actual gameplay rules of Pong. When I talk about world's rules, I'm talking about rules that define the way a game's world works. What it looks like and how a player might interact with the objects in that world. When I talk about gameplay rules, I'm talking about rules that define a game in the way it's won or lost. Here's a few rules from Pong that would fit into the category of world's rules. Each player controls only one paddle. The paddles can only move up or down. The paddles cannot move above or below the screen. The speed of the ball is affected by the speed and direction of the paddle it hits. There's a bunch of other rules, but we don't need to list every one of them. The point is, even though Pong is a simple game, there are quite a few rules that govern the world in which it takes places. It's another reminder of why we start of with simple projects when designing games. These rules we just listed help describe the world in which our game takes place. They help keep the objects in the world organized in a way that makes sense to the player. For instance, if we didn't have the paddles cannot move above or below the screen as a rule, the player might accidentally move the paddle far below the bottom of the screen, and be unable to find it. If we didn't say that the paddles could only move up or down, the players might move their paddles side to side, and start bumping into each other. It would be total chaos. Other rules are there to make the game more interesting for the players, such as the rule that let's players affect the speed of the ball by the speed and direction of their paddle. Giving them the power to speed up or slow down the ball allows a greater level of skill to be involved in the game, and allows the game to be played differently as the player continues to practice. And it keeps that game interesting after repeated matches. So those are the rules that define our world. How about the rules that define the game that takes place in our world? Now we move on the gameplay rules. While our first type of rules define the place in which the game happens, these rules set out how the game is played. In more complicated games, the gameplay rules may also help explain the narrative aspects of the game and lay out the various goals a player needs to achieve to complete your game. In Pong, some examples of this type of rule would be, the ball starts from the dotted line in the middle of the screen, moving at a medium speed towards the right side of the screen.
Yes? >> Well, that rule seems complicated. Why don't we just tell the computer to serve the ball to the player on the right. >> Well, that assumes that the computer knows how to play ping pong. A computer doesn't know how to serve a ball, it doesn't even know what the word serve means. That's what these rules are for. If we didn't tell the computer to start from middle, the ball might start on the left edge of screen and score a point for the right player before anybody had a chance to react. If we didn't request a specific speed, the computer might make the ball too fast or too slow. The actual rule is probably even more specific, maybe mentioning the exact angle at which the ball moves. When we're making rules we have to be very clear, because unclear rules can be really easily misinterpreted. Here's some more game rules from Pong. If the ball passes off to the left side of the screen, the right player receives one point. And vice versa for the other player. If the right player scores, the next ball will start on the dotted line, and move at a medium speed towards the other player, and vice versa for the other player. The first player to reach 11 points wins the game. When either player wins, the game ends. Pong is a simple game, but there's quite a few rules. Notice how if any of these are removed, the game becomes impossible to play or win. For instance, without the rule that tells us how the ball appears and starts moving, we'd never have a ball to play with. If the first rule didn't tell us how the ball was moving, we might have a ball appear at the start of the game, but just sit in the middle of the screen. Rule 6 tells us that the game is won when a player gets to 11 points, but without rule 7 telling us that the game ends after somebody wins, the players would keep on playing forever, and the game would never end. The reason I'm breaking up rules into two categories is to help me organize rules in my project. Most games will need a lot of rules. So it pays to stay organized. Breaking them up into the world and gameplay rules work for me. but there are different ways of organizing and describing rules among different game designer, different game companies, and even in the same company with different games. The important thing is not that you choose to organize your rules in this exact way, but that you organize them in a way that is clear to you and your collaborators, and in a way that makes sense for your game.

[SOUND] Let's change the rules so all red cards are wild. >> Why, do you have a bunch of red cards that you can't use? >> No. >> You can't change the rules halfway through a card game, but you can change the rules half way through a video game. >> [SOUND] >> It's true, how many times have you been playing a game only to have gravity to suddenly reverse itself? In Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, sometimes your gun gets broken and starts shooting in the wrong direction, or your oxen get confused and then, all the directions on your controller go the opposite direction you're used to. When designing a game, you can change the rules whenever you feel like the current set of rules are becoming too predictable. Usually when this happens, there's some reason seen by the player. For instance, they stepped on a trap and that reversed gravity, or they dropped their gun and it broke, which is what caused it to start shooting in the wrong direction. Usually, unless you want to confuse your players, which is a possibility, it's best to let them know why you've changed the rules, so they know that their computer isn't busted. Changing or adjusting the rules can keep your game interesting and unpredictable. There are also simpler reasons why you might want to change the rules of your game from time to time, for more structural and narrative reasons. Let's say you have a sequence where your character is talking with an old friend. Maybe the character's rocket launcher should be disabled for conversation sequences where it might produce unwanted story results. If your character is going to be in a store, maybe they shouldn't be able to use their sneaky skills to steal everything there. It might make the game too easy. These sorts of rule changes are used to keep the game at a right level of difficulty and they're also used to simplify programming and keep the designer from having to create parts of the game that aren't needed for their intended story. As a game designer, you set the rules and you break them, too. Just keep in mind, when the rules change, so will your game play. Keep in mind that this may affect your game. Will it bring interesting variety? Will it simplify the programming? Will it have positive effects, without confusing or frustrating the player in unintended ways? Give it a try and see what happens.

How do your players figure out the rules for your game? Are they reading instructions or using trial and error? Like most things in video game design, a well thought out plan for how your players will discover your rules can help your game more enjoyable and interesting for everyone who picks it up. [MUSIC] Documentation.
Some rare players might want to read instructions for your game, but they are the exception to the rule. Most players will not look in the box for a manual or search for it online before they start up your game and give it a try. Though some manuals are well designed and some can contain interesting tips, illustrations and extras, few are read, and games should make sense to a player who is only learning the game by playing it. This isn't to say that your players won't be doing any reading in the game. Lots of games have in-game documentation. These aren't usually manuals and they rarely get longer than a few sentences. A screen may pop-up with some text that explains the rules of gameplay or some item in your inventory may labeled with text explaining it's purpose. Try to keep this sort of documentation clear and brief when it's used. Every time your player has to stop playing to read instructions, it takes them out of the game a little bit. [MUSIC] Narration.
One step up from documentation is narration. Instead of giving us text to read, some games choose to give us audio narration to guide us through gameplay. The nice part about this method is it can often happen in the background as a player continues to explore. The player can continue to be inside the game. Just make sure that your narration isn't redundant. It should explain things in your game that the player can't learn in other ways. >> Fran said thoughtfully. >> That's redundant. You're not giving the audience any new information. >> Fran said, annoyed? >> [SOUND] If narration is used well, it can be integrated into your story and it can tell the player things they would have no other way of knowing. Sometimes a game might turn the narration into a character in itself. Portal and Portal 2 are games that do this brilliantly. The narration comes from characters that are rarely seen, but since the narration itself always has unique personality, the player feels like they're listening to a character and experiencing the game, rather than listening to an instruction book. [MUSIC] In-Game Discovery. There is an old rule in writing. Show, don't tell.
What it means is that, when possible, a player should be experiencing the story with all their senses rather than just being told things. My friend and I have worked out a little example here.
>> Don't eat these things. They'll make you explode.
I wonder what one of these things taste like. [SOUND] >> Notice how both of these examples explain the exact same thing. If you eat that thing, you explode. However, the tell version is a lot less interesting, exciting, and memorable than the show version. Whenever possible, try to let your players discover the rules by experiencing them. For example, if a large part of your game involves a character doing acrobatics at death-defying heights, maybe the first level can give them some space where they can jump around closer to the ground. They can explore their abilities in an environment where initial mistakes won't result in their immediate death. And they can get to understand the rules before moving on to the tough stuff. If you wanna check out a game where all three of these techniques are used together, try out Trine, which lets you discover the gameplay rules at the start of the game through documentation. There's a storybook text, and there's some narration. There's a classic storybook narrator telling you about the characters. But there's also some early levels that are set up to give you a chance to try out all the different powers and abilities of all the three playable characters.

Now, time to talk about this week's assignment. I like what you all came up with last week, and there were some really interesting games out there. For this week, I'd like you to take a look at your game and really start thinking about how changes and adjustments to your rules can make it more engaging, interesting, and fun. Here's some questions you can ask yourself as you're working, or if you feel that you're running into problems.
What are the rules for my game?
In what ways can I change my rules to make my game play differently? For instance, if your player uses dice to figure out how many spaces they move, how would it change the game if they only moved on odd numbered rolls. What would happen if, when ever they rolled a six, they went back to the start? Remember to try out your game, as you adjust it. Another question to ask yourself might be, are my rules balanced? For instance, if half my spaces say skip ahead six spaces, the game might be over too quickly. If half tell you to move back six spaces, you'll never get to the end. What happens if you adjust your rules? And how does that change the balance of your game? So that's all for this week. Good luck with your assignments. I'm looking forward to seeing what you all come up with.

[SOUND] Fran was supposed to be here two hours ago. Where is that slacker?
>> Sorry, everybody, I'm late. I just had a weird morning. Welcome to the third week in this course, where we'll be talking about. What a story can do for your games. how a story can make your games more interesting and emotionally involving. And how a story can make your games inspiring to a player, how they can inspire you to make better games. What do we mean when we say story in the context to a game. I'm gonna be using it in a really broad way today. When I say story, I'm talking about something that is added to your game to give it context. So it tells us where we are and what we're looking at. Or it gives us a narrative, it tells us what's happening in our world. Context for a game can be very simple. If we take a look at Pong, for example, and we try to figure out what's going on, just based on what we're seeing and hearing during game play. We know we're dealing with a game that involves a screen divided in half, there are two player controlled rectangles and a square that bounces around. There are also some bleeps and bloops in the audio. However, just by adding the word Pong to the title, the game now has some context. The player knows that they're using a high tech ping pong simulator. And then he can imagine that the screen is a ping pong table. They can imagine that the two rectangles are paddles, and that the little square is a ball. They're using their imagination to expand the world of the game, outside its technical limitations. Even though the little square has corners, people think of it as a ball. By giving the player some context or narrative to go with their game, you're giving them something to think about. You're telling them that the world of the game extends beyond the borders of the screen. You're giving them things to think about, and things to wonder about. When I showed up today with my arm in a bandage, there's a story. You as the audience might have wondered, why? Why was I late? What had happened to me before I got here. Or what happened to my arm. It's a really small thing. But it introduces something for you to think about, and to be curious about, and it hints at a world outside of the starting point. >> So what happened to your arm?
>> Nothing, I was just using it as a simple example of a narrative element. You're a liar, friend! >> Well if you want to tell stories, you have to make things up.

Now that we know what a story is, let's talk about why we need one in our games. After all, there are a lot of games that seem to have very minimal stories and they're quite successful, like Tetris. And a lot of games that have a ton of story and don't do so well. The weird thing about video games is almost none of it is real. Mario, is not alive somewhere hanging out between games. Sonic, isn't alive somewhere running really fast. It's all made up. Kind of makes you feel sad. But we can have strong emotional connections with characters because of the stories that we have with them. They've taken us on adventures and we've helped them through some hard times and some tough levels. Story is powerful that way. Let's talk about The Purpose of Story, what it can do for your games, and how it can make your game better. [SOUND] Communication. A story helps you communicate your game to your self and to other people. At some point someone is going to ask you about your game. What's it about? Or late at night after a lot of brainstorming, you might be asking yourself the same question. What's my game about? Usually your story is gonna be the answer to that question. It's people's introduction to your game. It's the way to think about your game during production. It's very, very important that your game can be communicated clearly. A long time ago, I was trying to develop a show for Cartoon Network and I was trying to describe it to a Cartoon Network executive named Linda Simensky. And I couldn't explain it clearly, and she said, friend, you have to realize that at some point the success of your cartoon is going to rely on whether or not one five year old can explain it to another five year old at recess. I'm not saying your audience is a bunch of five year olds, but rather, when you're talking about your game, a clear explanation is really important. And it helps open up your game to a wide audience. [SOUND] Inspiration. Without a story or some context for your game, it can be very hard to get it started. That's because without someplace to start, your possibilities are limitless. That may sound like a good thing, but it can also give you a directionless feeling. If you need to design a character or a level and your game could be anywhere in any time period, there is no place for you to start. However, if you make a clear decision, maybe your game is about, let's say, a spy in 1930s Moscow, you have a much easier task ahead of you. First off, it narrows down your possible decisions tremendously. You can narrow your focus to a specific time period, a specific location, in a specific profession.
You won't be distracted by all the other possibilities out there. You can concentrate on some specific choices. Ironically, while finding these story elements helps narrow your focus, it also opens up a ton of material you can potentially use to get ideas for your project. You can dig into some old books about your setting, you can read about spies from that time period, or from that location. You can look into history books of possible conflicts, and you can check out historical pictures for inspiring imagery. All these things can help make your game a richer and more involving experience for your player, and for yourself. [SOUND] Emotion. What do you want your audience to feel while they're playing your game? Happy? Sad? Excited? Confused? Now we could try to impart these emotions without a story. We could try to make an audience happy by showing them some happy colors and playing some happy music. But it'll be really difficult. What if they didn't like the colors we like? What if they didn't like the music we like? Will be really hard to get a specific emotion from someone without some kind of story? Story allows us to show specific things to bring more specific emotions. In games, we have a huge advantage over other media, we have empathy. Since a player usually sees themselves as the main character of a game, if things happen to that character, the player often feels like these things are happening directly to them. To see how much we get inside our games, you only have to watch someone play a car-racing game. See how much they lean into the corners, even though it has absolutely no effect on the game whatsoever? It's because they feel like they're in that little car or on the screen. If you crash that car, or if you suddenly have the power to fly in that car, you are putting emotions directly into your players, and you're connecting them closely to your game. [SOUND] Surprise. When someone plays a game they're usually looking for a combination of two elements. Things that are expected and things that are surprises. People play Super Mario Brothers partly because they like stomping on mushrooms. And they know that they can stomp a lot of mushrooms in that game. However, players are also looking for surprises. Things that they aren't expecting. Surprises get your audience thinking and thinking keeps them more involved in your game. Imagine your story is about a zombie invasion and your players have seen a bunch of zombies. After a few levels, they may encounter something that at first appears to be a zombie, but is actually just a clumsy person with valuable information about the following level. It's a surprise that's set up by the previous story. With a story, you can set up expectations and create history, and you can break with that history to create a twist that can give your characters a surprise and keep them interested in the game. [SOUND] Motivation. What's the goal of your game? The story can help explain the purpose of your game to the player. And it can help lead them through to the thrilling conclusion. Of course, a player can just be playing for a maximum score or something that's really not connected to the story but it can be much more interesting and inspiring to give them a story. And a reason to struggle their way through a game. The character might be trying to rescue someone, like in Super Mario Brothers or Limbo. They're two very different games with the same basic plot. The player might be motivated to find some lost treasure or ride a horrible injustice. The added benefit is that all these challenges and motivations can help inspire you to create a more interesting game. And they can give you ideas about the path of your game. And they can inspire more levels and challenges along the way.
Specificity, story and context help to make your game feel specific. Pick a game like Flappy Bird it's pretty simple. Now imagine if instead of guiding a little bird between a series of columns you were guiding a square through a series of rectangles it would be the same basic game play and would just be as challenging. But it would also feel kind of generic. Take a moment to browse through a few online game stores. There are a lot of games that feel like clones, lots of Tetris, Pong and Breakout style games. Often, what makes them feel generic, is their lack of story. Maybe they're using imagery that doesn't really have any story or context or maybe is because they're using imagery so generic that it doesn't help them set their game apart from any of the other games out there. With a little story and the context to let your players know where they are, you can make your game less generic feeling. It can become a specific unique game. So in conclusion, story is not absolutely necessary to make a game. There are games that barely have any story. You can make a game with no story just as you could make a game with no color, no sound, or no main character or representational imagery at all. You can make a very simple game. But each time you decide to leave out an element of gaming you have less tools in your toolkit and less ways to get your players interested and excited about your game.

So who's in charge of your game story? A lot of game designers probably think that they are. They're creating the whole story, programming all the elements, and figuring out all the paths a player might take. A lot of players probably feel like they are making the decisions and performing the actions that carry them through the adventure. So who writes the story of a video game?
Ideally it's a collaboration between the game designer and the player. Neither person should feel bored during the process. But the designer needs to accept the player's place as co-author of their story.
Players want to feel like they are in charge of the direction in the story. They want to make the storyline their own and they want to leave a mark on the path of the narrative. When making your game, there are a few different styles for how a story develops, and each has its own positive and negative qualities. I'm going to go over three that I think are the most common ways a player finds the story in a game. These can be helpful for troubleshooting your game if you feel like there's a conflict between the way your players are experiencing your project and the way you see that experience developing through playtesting.

Writer-Driven. Now this is the easiest way as a writer to communicate your story to the audience.
In effect, you take the player out of the equation. This can be achieved by taking all the decision-making power out of the hands of the player. Now one of the most common ways to do this is with a cutscene. It happens in other ways as well. Sometimes a writer gives a player such limited decisions that they essentially have no options. For example, if you put a character in a tunnel and their only choice is to walk down the tunnel with no other paths, they have no choices. Also a character might be given many options of what to do, but all of them have the same result. If the writer needs to explain that a player has been kidnapped by a fancy octopus and taken to an underwater kingdom, the writer can insert a cutscene that shows the fancy octopus grabbing the hero and shows their arrival to the undersea city. As a player, I'm sure you're aware of some of the disadvantages of this style. First, it removes your player's sense of control and connection to their character. They have been controlling this character for hours. They have developed that great sense of empathy that we talked about earlier. It's one of the main things we're hoping to create in our audience. If you take away the player's control, they feel like they suddenly aren't inside their character anymore.
Worse still, they have to watch somebody else play their character. And that's the second disadvantage with this narrative style. The writer controls the main character and makes choices for the player and not the other way around. This can be very frustrating for the player. Especially if they've been playing an athletic character for the past few hours, a character that can easily outmaneuver that fancy octopus who should have no chance of kidnapping them. >> Oh, calm down, friend, that was a long time ago. >> I know, it's just very frustrating when I'm playing a character and then I feel like someone else takes over and they're doing a bad job at playing my character and they're messing up the story for me. >> Uh-huh. >> Anyways, those are the disadvantages of using a writer-driven way to communicate and drive your story. However, even with these obvious disadvantages, this style gets used all the time, so you're probably wondering why.
Well, there are actually a lot of advantages to this method.
First, it helps keep your game simple. By reducing the number of choices for your player, you're also reducing the number of choices you have to program, write, and animate.
It's hard to make a game where a character is able to do anything, and limiting the choices available helps to keep your game as simple as possible. And remember how important it is to keep things simple. Second, it allows a writer to make choices that are more appropriate for a game character, but that a player might not make. For example, the main character of a game might be a brilliant rocket scientist. If the person playing the game is not a brilliant rocket scientist and they run into a problem that requires rocket repair and complex trajectories, it might make sense for the player to temporarily lose control as the game character fixes up a rocket and does their complicated science thing. Third, it lets the writer tell a lot of story without being interrupted. Sometimes a story can grow too big to tell into little chunks spread sporadically throughout the game. Letting the writer take over for a while is a way to do a lot of explanation in one big chunk. Fourth and probably one of the most narratively useful reasons to take control from your players is to force players to make mistakes. Think of every other form of storytelling we have. Movies, books, songs, comics. How many movies have you seen where the main character never makes a mistake? How many songs are about regret of past decisions? Mistakes are one of the most useful things a main character can do. A big mistake can change the mood of your story and serve as the turning point for your whole game. A mistake can create problems that can be solved by the player, and players love solving problems. However, players also have the ability to save and restore their games. You could put a pile of donuts in a middle of a clearing and when a character goes to grab those donuts, they might fall through a trap door where your story turns the corner and they spend the next five levels finding their way out of the caverns of the mole creatures. However, the character can always restore their game and play the scenario again. They'll have fallen for that trap before. They won't wanna fall for it again. They will try all sorts of methods to get those donuts without setting off the trap, but in the end, they'll feel silly when they have to go step knowingly into a trap just to keep the game going. Players wanna make good decisions. They don't wanna be forced to make bad decisions, even if it helps you move your story along. As an aside, I think this is why many games use main characters with troubled pasts. The character can have a history of past mistakes that are catching up on them, and these can affect the game without making the character feel like they're messing up.
Also, this probably is why games have sidekicks with questionable decision-making powers.
How many times has a sidekick run into a room before you've have a chance to check it for danger and you've had to run in after them in order to rescue them from the trouble they're causing? These methods and many others help to put some of those wonderful mistakes into the game without forcing a player to make decisions and taking away their collaborative power in the story. I do have to say, if it's not already clear, that I feel that style of writer-driven stories should be avoided whenever possible. Maybe by simplifying your story or reworking the way that you're choosing to tell a certain part. Remember to accept your player as a collaborator in your game.

0:00
Writer-Led. At a glance, writer-led might look a lot like writer-driven, but they're very different approaches to telling your story. The main goal of the writer-led method is lead your player through your story by exciting their curiosity, rather than making their choices for them directly. For instance, if a character is walking through a large dungeon with many passages but they hear a ghostly voice in the distance, they might move towards it. You could use that to bring them to the next point of your story. You could also know that some players might be scared of ghosts, and they might move away from the voice. So you could also make some sort of plans for that outcome. Maybe wandering monsters could also steer your player towards the desired location. The advantages of this method are that it keeps your player as the main decision-maker for their character. It also keeps them inside the character for the entire game.
The disadvantages are that it's often more complex and time consuming for the game designer. If given enough thought and time, most things that are told in a writer-driven way could probably be told in a writer-led way. Leading your audience with their curiosity will be more rewarding for your players but probably more time consuming for you. It's a choice you'll need to make as you balance the complexity of your game with the time and resources you have to put it together.

Player led.
There's a third way that stories are told with games and it's something that can make a game much more involving and fun for your audience. Sometimes a player can make their own stories inside a game, stories that weren't even intended by the designer. Sometimes this happens when a player intentionally decides to mess with the game. For instance, my dad is really into building and playing race car simulators. He likes the realism and the detail and whenever I've tried his race car simulators, the first thing I do is turn the car around in the wrong direction and drive it the wrong way around the track. This kind of annoys my Dad, but in the end we're both having fun with the game.
This can also happen when the player makes their own challenges. I knew this kid in grade school who could beat the first few levels of Super Mario Brothers with a blindfold on. It's probably not an intentional challenge built by the game designers, but it's something that added to the fun of the game. Other players might try to make it through a difficult level of fighting game without encountering any of the enemies, which can add to the difficulty and greatly change the story of a fighting game. There are even games where the majority of the story is made by players creating their own challenges.
Sim City might see a player trying to build the biggest skyscraper. Minecraft might see a player try to corner the market on all the world's gold. And goat simulator might see the player try to get their goat do a specific trick on a bicycle. It's difficult to make a game, where the player can create their own story. But that is all the more reason to test your games as many players as you can. You never know when a player might find a new and interesting approach to your game.

The game story that works well is written by the game designer and a player. This is a difficult concept to get used to since often we associate stories with non-interactive media like movies and books. Also we often write alone. The player isn't around to mess with the flow of our story.
It would really helpful if we could write a story with the player helping out. Playing their part and reminding us of their unique goals and motivations. This is why I strongly encourage you all to try out role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons as you work on your stories. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the way that Dungeons and Dragons works, there are two types of players in a typical game. There is the dungeon master. They make all the decisions about what is going on in the world, what all the creatures are up to and they are similar to a game designer, only they work in real time. The other type of player is the player character. They decide the actions of one of the main characters in the game. You can think of them as similar to a player in a video game. The dungeon master describes the setting and the player characters react to the world. The reason I'm bringing this up is that it's an interesting way to try out your game. And a good way to see how a player might react to different situations in your game.
I'm gonna try this out with my friend over here and I'll be the dungeon master. Are you ready to play the game? >> Sure, why not. >> Great. I think I've got a pretty good game figured out. It's about a mystical adventure into the caverns of Death Mountain to retrieve the magic fire crystals. [MUSIC] So I'll describe the initial setting. You're standing outside the giant capital city of your land. On the horizon, you see an imposing silhouette of death mount, land of adventure. What do you wanna do? >> That capital city sounds interesting. I'm gonna go there and buy a magic sword.
I sure could use a magic sword. >> And well I have a whole adventure planned in Death Mountain. >> And I have a shopping trip planned.
And I want a magic sword.
So clearly, I have not planned this adventure in a way that brings my story along in a way I had intended. And trying out my story with my friend here, has helped me find problems in it. So let's try that again, but this time, I am gonna try to help guide my player along my intended story line with a little different approach. Are you ready? >> [SOUND]. [NOISE] >> So you're standing outside a giant capital city of your land and it's night and all the shops are closed, every one of them. On the horizon you see the imposing silhouette of Death mountain, land of adventure. What do you want to do? >> All the stores are closed? Even the ones with the magic swords?
>> Yep, they're all closed, the lights are off, all of them. Death Mountain stands on the horizon, a stark beacon of danger and adventure. >> Cool, I'm gonna break into all the stores and steal all their magic swords. >> But what about the magic fire crystals? >> I don't even know what those things do.
I'm going for the magic swords. >> So clearly that didn't work. But let's say I have a whole free weekend and I try out many variations of my game with a few helpful players. I might end up with [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> I am ready for adventure. >> So, you find yourself on the beach. You are on an island where your ship was wrecked in last night's storm. In the distance behind swaying tropical jungle trees you see the silhouette of Death Mountain, full of monsters and some say the magic fire crystals. >> I wanna fix my ship. >> All that remains of your ship is the poop deck. Did I mention that the magic fire crystals are said to be more powerful than the most powerful of all magic swords? >> Okay, I'm still gonna eat all the coconuts on this island. >> You've gained 42 health points. >> Nice, now it's time to check out that mountain. You are immediately attacked by three trolls and scene, thanks. This is not to say that all players are a pain in the butt. And they all aren't trying to go against the story of your game. However, in general gamers are looking for a challenge. If I was to say that a certain jump is unjumpable, all the players would try to jump it. If I was to say that a certain monster was undefeatable, all the players would try to defeat it. So the same thing happens when I try to tell an audience, I know there's a city here, but it's not part of the story. Continue with my story direction, doing that sort of thing is not allowing my players to collaborate with my story, it's shutting them out. The more your story can include the decisions of your players, the more your players will feel involved with your game. For this reason, it's always a good idea to test your stories and your ideas with your test players. You don't need to wait until you have a working game prototype. You can invite testers at any point to see your ideas and to try out your story. The earlier you can involve your players in your story planning, the better. It will give you a game where your story feels more integrated with your game. Rather than tacked on at the end. It's very helpful to start with your story as early as you can. Also, sometimes a clever player might have a really interesting or unique approach to your adventure. You'll never know unless you try.

Hey, let's try a little experiment. Hey pal, would you want to eat this thing? >> What? No. I don't even know what that thing is. >> Well, how about this? Would you eat this? >> No. You are a horrible person. >> Well, how about this? Would you eat this thing? >> Yes. Wait, what did you do with the cat? >> Nothing. There's actually no power pellet, kitten, or sandwich. They're made up. I used them as imagery to change your reaction. Sorry for tricking you in the name of science. >> Ugh, but I'm still hungry. >> Well, here, have a granola bar.
There's a lot of objects in games. Bricks, robot fists, books, planets, magic hats. And there are a lot of ways to represent these objects. What we should keep in mind is that the way we represent the objects in our game has a big effect on how our audience will interact with them. Just as in our earlier example, it really changes the interaction if we have a power-up that looks like a generic pellet or a kitten or a sandwich. The audience has a different reaction to all three. Using specific imagery has some big advantages. It can give your world a rich and detailed look. It can also help communicate to your player, telling them how to interact with these objects. A player has probably seen kittens and sandwiches before and probably has some ideas for how to interact with them. So why isn't all imagery specific? Why do we still see generic-looking pellets and boring-looking objects in video games? Well, sometimes the designer doesn't have time to add detail to everything. They might choose to only give details to the most important pieces of their game. Because their game has too many objects to give each one a unique and interesting design. Another reason could be that the design of a game could become cluttered if every single object had a detailed and unique design. The world can't be made of fancy sandwiches and kittens. Some objects need to be simple in order to push the player's attention towards more important things. Balancing simple and complicated things is an important part of game design and the use of contrast is one of the most powerful tools you have to work with. A third powerful reason that you may want to keep a design simple is that you are using more than just imagery when you're describing your world to the player. Let's take our generic power pellet as an example. What if your player finds themselves at a seedy underworld hangout, meeting an undercover informant? Just as a player is about to hear all the secrets from the informant, thugs show up and drag the informant out of the building. After the scene calms down and everyone's gone, the player finds the informant's bag in a pile of wreckage. And inside they find a mysterious pellet. What could it be? The story can tell the audience how to interact with the object. And this is a melodramatic example. What if the object is just singing a little song when the player approaches? What if the object moves in an interesting and unique way, hopping around like a rabbit? What if the player can fly whenever they hold the object? We have a lot of ways to communicate to our audience. And it's important that we are aware of all the tools we have when we're describing our world and telling our stories. When a player encounters an object, we can tell them about it through imagery, like showing it as a pellet, a kitten, a sandwich, or literally anything else. We can use story, like finding an object in that informant's bag. We can use sound, it can play a little song. We can use behavior, it can be moving a certain way. And we can use interaction, the object might have an effect on the player and the other objects that are in the world. Now that's a lot of decision making and you probably won't be going through that process for every single object in your game. But it's something that you probably want to keep in mind for the more important objects and environments. The objects in your world help to tell a story to your players. Each decision you make can have a big effect on how your player interacts with the game. So ask yourself, how do I want my player to feel? And then try to find the method that helps to find those feelings inside your audience.

Now it's time for this weeks assignment. We're going to take our games and think about adding to their story. They're looking great so far, but is there a way you can get your audience even more involved with your game, using a little story?
If there is a story already, is there a way you can improve it? Here's some questions you can ask yourself as you're working, or if you feel that you're running into problems. What is my story?
If you start off with a game with just a simple path, but in one version you're running from monsters, and in another you're competing in an auto race, each one of those stories will lead to different problems and solutions as you make your game. What is my story doing to affect my game? What is my story doing to affect my character? Does the story change the way a player might act? For instance, if I make a game and the main character's a werewolf, would that change my player reacted to pictures of full moons and silver bullets? Are the players discovering things as they go through your game? Meaning what do they learn at the start, the middle, and at the end of your game? What are they learning about the world and the challenges along the way? Are there parts of your story that can be removed without changing your story? If there's something that if you were to remove it, your game still feels just as good, maybe you should remove it. Remember, every element you add, is another thing that has to be designed, programmed and tested. Simplicity can really help. If you show your game to a friend, and then ask them to tell the story back to you, what do they say? That one can be really helpful, since your game might not be communicating what you think. Sometimes you can be really surprised when you find out your game is communicating something totally different than what you intended. So, that's all for this week, good luck with your assignments. I'm looking forward to seeing what you all come up with.

[MUSIC] Hello, and welcome back. Over the course of this class, we have started off by making some simple games, and we've grown them along the way. We've adjusted and balanced our rules, and we've added some narrative and graphic elements, to make the game experience more compelling for our players. And, we've given our classmates feedback each week. For this week, which is the last one for this introductory class, we'll be talking about characters and multiplayer elements that can be added to our games. The different ways they're used and the ways that we can use them to make your game a more fun experience for your players. Bringing in extra characters for your player to interact with, whether they be real-life friends in a multiplayer game, or computer operated characters can bring personalities, surprise, and unpredictability to your game. Isn't that right, pal? >> [NOISE]

There are two kinds of characters in a video game, a PC and an NPC. PC stands for player character, and they're characters in the game that are controlled by real humans. For instance, Mario is a PC in Super Mario Brothers, and PAC-MAN is a PC in PAC-MAN. Multiplayer games can have more than one PC, but the general rule is that any character is a PC if a real human gets to control their actions. NPC stands for non-player character, and it refers to any character controlled by the computer. In PAC-MAN, the ghosts are all NPC's. In Super Mario Brothers, all the mushrooms, the princess, and every character who isn't Mario is an NPC. >> Am I a PC or an NPC? >> Well, you're a PC because a human controls your actions. >> What?
How can you get personality into your NPC's? It may seem impossible at first, to trick a player into believing that your NPC is a real thinking character, but people are always projecting personalities onto inanimate objects. How many times have you heard a friend or a co-worker say, my computer is out to get my today, or my car has been temperamental lately. Their computers aren't out to get them and their car isn't temperamental. They're just wanting something from machine, and the machine is letting them down and creating emotions, so your friend then uses the bits of information they have to make a narrative to go with their experience. Let's take a simple example that could work in your game project. If your player was moving along a path and they were rolling standard dice to see how many space they could move. The dice would give them a number between one and six, so on average they would be moving about three and a half spaces. If your game was a car game, you could make an NPC opponent that would compete with your player. What would happen if this NPC moves three spaces every turn? Well, your player's moving three and a half spaces on average, so this NPC moving only three spaces would normally lose. If the NPC moved four spaces every turn, they would win on average, but these races would normally be pretty close. Now, what would happen if we made an NPC that could move only one or two spaces every turn? They'd be slow, and they'd usually lose. They now have a quality that's outside the norm, they're especially slow. The player might start projecting some personality onto this NPC, seeing them as a sad, unlucky loser. >> Well that car never wins, what a slow poke. What if we had a NPC that moved five or six spaces every turn? They'd almost always win and the player would almost certainly develop some strong feelings towards this NPC, seeing them as a difficult adversary or a villain. >> Who is that super fast driver? Can I steal their car in this game? >> By changing just one number, we can take two identical NPC's and change them into two characters that the player will see as having different personalities, a slowpoke and a super faster racer. Now, all along we've been stressing simplicity in our game making, and this is an illustration of why. We're keeping our rules minimal and we're letting the players imagination create the story. Imagine the way your game would be seen as different if the imagery representing your NPC's were designed in different ways. If we took the NPC racer that moves only one or two spaces each turn, the perpetual loser, and designed them to look like a fancy race car driver with an expensive race car, the player might see them as an over funded but incompetent driver who is all show and no go. If we took the NPC that moves five or six spaces each turn, the perpetual winner, and designed them to look like a rough and tumble racer with a beat up old car, the player might see them as a lucky old timer. All these personalities and emotions are created by adjusting one number and a bit of imagery. These small changes can be quite powerful in shaping the experience of your player, and these NPC's are essentially just running a script. They aren't reacting at all to what's happening during the game play. So what if they did? What if we created an NPC that always moved one or two spaces until they were losing, and then they'd always move five or six spaces each turn? We'd have a character that might seem kind of clueless at first, and then fiercely competitive. What if we had an NPC character that did the opposite? They could start out moving five or six spaces per turn until they were ahead and then only move one or two spaces per turn when they were in the lead. This would make a character that might seem like a show-off who is just toying with your player and wouldn't you love to beat that darn show-off at a race? >> Oh, I wanna beat that show off. They're driving me crazy. >> Well that's the point. The previous example created some extra personality for our NPC characters, by giving them a condition whether or not they were winning. NPC's can react to all sorts of things. Maybe a NPC might only start to move when the player gets too close. Maybe they might only appear after a player reaches a certain number of points or chooses a certain path. All these conditional behaviors can be use to make your NPC's feels like they are thinking, and that makes them more believable to your players. Remember, you don't need to make NPC's that actually think, you just need to make NPC characters who appear to be thinking, like this guy over here.
>> I'm thinking some deep thoughts. >> Sure you are.

So what types of characters does your game need? Does your game need a villain? Is it important to have a bad guy? Let's ask an expert. >> It's very important to have a bad guy in your game. [LAUGH] >> Huh. Well, let's talk about some of the types of non-player characters you might include in your game, and the purposes they might serve. [SOUND] Villains. Villains are great. They mess up stuff, so your hero will need to fix it. They give personality to the problems your player needs to solve. A good villain can make a series of problems feel like a specific adventure. If your villain is doing their job, they'll create some strong adversarial feelings with your player, and make the victory all the sweeter. However, keep in mind that sometimes villians can make our planning too easy. They can end up behind every single problem, and that might get repetitive or even nonsensical. Don't forget that there is all sorts of reasons your player could find challenges that could be outside a villians power, like mistakes, or natural disasters, or a betrayal. [SOUND] Townspeople. Adding some towns people can help make your world feel like a real place with real consequences. If everyone is a hero or a monster, your game can feel unreal or cartoonish, which isn't always a bad thing. But a towns person can tell your player what their world is like, they can tell stories, give tips, or fill in details from your game that your player wasn't around to experience otherwise. [MUSIC] Adventurers. Your player might run into fellow adventurers, they could be good, or not so nice, they could help your players, or they could be competing with your player towards the same goal. The nice thing about adventurers, is sometimes, they've already tried the things your player is about to attempt. And they can have unique perspectives and secrets that they might share for a price. [MUSIC] Friends. Running in to old friends is a good way of adding back story to your game. A character's friends can tell you a lot about that character. If all their friends are woodland animals or spiders or nerds or jocks or imaginary, it's going to say something about that character. [SOUND] Monsters. Classic monsters. Monsters in every shape and size, from the microscopic to the planet-sized, they're the most widely used NPCs in all of video games. Monsters aren't only there to challenge your character, they can also help your player learn something about their world, or even change the course of your adventure. For instance, your player might encounter a bear, and when your player is bitten, they might suddenly have a strong taste for honey. [NOISE] And they become a ware-bear! That could really change the course of your game.
Turn coats and traitors. Speaking of wear bears, any of these characters can change into any other character. A friend might become a monster, a monster might become a friend, who knows? When you feel like you need to add a new character to your project, take a moment to ask yourself if the point you are trying to achieve can be met by revisiting a previous character and learning something new about them. That way, you'll end up with a character that has more depth rather than two characters that you've only partially developed. This is by no means a complete list of character types. I didn't even get into hermits, or ghosts, or astronauts. The list goes on. The point is, there's a lot a new character can add to your story, and there's a lot an old character can add to your story if something new is revealed in them.

Whatever you do with the rules, it's important that they have balance. And what do I mean by that? Well, here's a short example. Hey, do you want to play an awesome game I just made up? >> Oh boy, awesome games are my favorite kind of games. >> Great, it's called super checkers. It's like regular checkers, only I start with the regular number of 20 checkers and you start with just one checker. That makes your checker 20 times more important to you, and it makes the game 20 times more challenging for you. What do you think? >> You have ruined checkers. >> Clearly, this would not be a balanced game for both players. How do you make a multi-player game that has balance? The easiest way is to have both characters start with identical abilities. In this example, we'd go back to the regular game of checkers with both players starting with the same number of checkers. What happens though when you want a game where both players need to have different abilities? That's where we need to think about balance in our rules. Now most of you have seen this before. Think of Street Fighter type games. There is usually a choice between characters with different advantages and disadvantages. A character might be powerful but slow. Another might be weaker but fast. Ideally, none of the character choices should be a guarantee of victory or defeat. If that were the case, why play the game? Try out your character balances with play testers and if they can't all agree which character is the best choice, it's a good sign. Let's go back to Super Checkers and try to fix it. It's no fun if one person has twenty checkers and another only has one. There's no balance there. But what if the person with only one checker could make five moves in a row or move backwards or what if their checker could shoot lasers. You could draw an imaginary line on the board and it could zap opponents along the sight lines. I mean these changes can make the game more balanced. People might want to try both the 20-checker character and the 1-checker character instead of feeling like they're stuck with the bad character. Of course, this would need some play testing to make sure things are balanced. And numbers would need to be tweaked. Maybe you could only get 5 laser blasts or a few consecutive moves. It would need some testing. >> Oh, I volunteer to test the super checkers. Where are my lasers? >> Another type of balance we need to talk about in multiplayer games, is a balance between winners and losers. Have you ever played a game where at some point it felt like you were starting to lose and after that, it felt impossible to come back from behind and win? This can be disheartening to a player. It can make them stop trying, and can leave them feeling disconnected from your game. Hopefully a player will always feel like they are capable of winning, until the moment they lose. If you've seen any movies about sports, you know that these movies are rarely made about 60-0 victories. Close games are fun to be a part of, and they're interesting until the end. What are some methods to balance winners and losers in a multiplayer game? Well, there's a reason that when one character zaps another in a first-person shooter game, the loser just doesn't re-spawn right in front of the victorious player. That would not be a challenge. They re-spawn somewhere else where they have a chance to gather their senses and try again. Another example would be a battle type racing game like Mario Kart. Most cars have weapons that fire forward and visibility that's better in the front. This gives the winners a sleight disadvantage, as they can't see or shoot if the player is behind them. It also gives the losing players an advantage, they can pick off the players in front of them and take the lead. Balance is very important in multiplayer games. It's important to give the players an equal chance of winning the game. And it's also important to make sure that the game is designed to be a close game in order to keep it interesting all the way through for both players. And not just the winner.

Hi, my name's Adam Sprague, and I made a game called Hidden in Plain Sight. Why do I make games? Games are fun. That's a simple answer. Hidden in Plain Sight is a local multiplayer game, which means that you're playing it in the same room as the people that you're playing with. And so, by nature of that, I think that there's this fun shared experience when you're in the same room with somebody. I think that sharing a common experience is the core of building relationships with people. And, so when people are sitting around a table playing Monopoly, or whatever, I think that it forces and creates bonds between people. And so, I'm a big fan of games in general, but particularly, games where you're not in a room by yourself, but in a room with other people laughing and yelling at each other, and having fun like that. How did I get into making games?
I've been a gamer since I was a kid. My family bought an Apple 2 PC back in 1979 or something like that and it came with a couple games, and I've been playing games,
board games, video games, card games, tabletop games since, for my whole life. So I've been a gamer my whole life. And then, as I got into high school and college I got into computers and software and I was a software geek and merged my love of programming with games, making games. So how many projects have I tried? Dozens and dozens. I've started and failed more than I can count, projects. I come up with some idea, I start coding something, I get sort of a prototype put together, and come to realize that my vision was way too grand or it just gets boring.
Before the Xbox Live Indie games platform, before I learned about that I would start my game and then realize that I didn't really have any way to publish it or distribute it. And that was really kind of a downer to say I'm working so hard to make some game. But then, maybe if I'm lucky, maybe my friends will play it, but as just sort of a solo developer, there weren't really these kind of opportunities to publish as there are more and more today. And so when I learned that I could publish a game on the Xbox, like I said pay the $99 and put a game out on the marketplace, that was a real big motivator that hey I can actually do something and make a game and publish it. The other big piece of advice that I always give to new people who are getting into game development is just start small. Start with some very core, basic idea because it's a lot more work than you originally anticipate, and if you start off with your grand massively multiplayer game with all sorts of design and crafting elements and stuff and you think you're going to be able to get through it on your first try. It would be very, very difficult.
How's my experience been, being an indie developer? I was able to, I submitted my game, sort of on a whim to Indiecade in 2012 and it was accepted, and they liked it. And we went to IndieCade and met a lot of people up there. In general, I found the Indie community to be super helpful, friendly, resourceful. There's really no reason these days why somebody couldn't go out and make a game. I don't think there's much information available. There's so much support and it's a nice community of people who are all like-minded and supportive and cooperative, I think. How do I design a multiplayer game in a solitary bay? In this case, I really think I got pretty lucky. I made the game, and for example, Deathrace, where you are racing to the finish line and trying to be the first one to cross. It's by nature, a multiplayer game, but literally no one played it, except for me, sitting on the ground with four controllers in front of me >> [LAUGH] >> Before the game got released. So I did a lot of play testing just by myself. And a lot of sitting down with controllers really to just kind of see whether the game worked in a functional sort of way. And I had some sense that maybe people would like to play it and it might be kind of fun. I did a little bit of play testing with friends. And really only one or two sort of sessions.
>> Hm. >> But I really did get pretty lucky, I think, and I stumbled on something more than I, I don't know, I wish I could take credit for how successful the game has been. But I really just thought maybe a 100 people would buy it and then- >> [LAUGH] >> It would sort of drift off the radar, but it's really gone much further than I thought. The first time I had friends play it, was at a holiday party, And around 1 in the morning I had to leave because I needed to come home and go to sleep and stuff. And they'd stayed up playing it until 4 in the morning or something like that. So that was really the first sentence that I'd got that the game was actually fun, and not that they were just playing it to humor me, or something like that. So there's five different game modes. In most of the games, well I guess Ninja Party and Death Race are completes metric. Everybody follows the same sort of rules. In Knights versus Ninjas it's definitely asymmetric. The ninjas are trying to attack the royalty and the knights are trying to defend the royalty. And the mechanisms to balance that are the positions that the knights start in. They get to start in a defensive position. In order to balance that, the ninjas are faster.
Another little balance point is that the knights can't be killed, they can be stunned. You can knock them over but then they get right back up again. Where as the ninjas if they get hit then they get killed. And I balanced it by feel I guess. I just kind of like I said, I didn't do a whole lot of play testing. But I just kind of played around with it by myself. And I wish I could say that I made up some sheets and did a lot of number crunching or anything. But really it was just compounded by gut feeling, gut instinct. Luckily and happily as a result. So when you release a game on Steam, you can have little counters and little metrics that you can measure. I recently went and looked and over something like 25,000 rounds of foreplay or knights versus ninjas the knights have won 52% of the time. > >> [LAUGH] >> So that's, I mean that's about as you can get right in terms of balance. >> Yeah. >> So I was really pleased and happy to hear that I was, with so little work done into actual play testing >> I was really scared that if the ninjas were winning 80% of the time or something, that if it was inherently unbalanced, I'd be pretty disappointed. So it was pretty good to hear that it was 52. A reviewer wrote something which I didn't plan on, but he said that in Hidden in Plain Sight, he said the crown is light, and it gets passed along often, and I like that. >> [LAUGH] >> You know, you win but you don't get to stay the winner for long because you hit the replay button and therefore winning is fun. Losing there's not a whole lot of penalty.
And the games, the rounds are very quick, and very, they're quick and the turnover is very fast and I think there's something very satisfying about that. I wanted to put each player in an internal state of conflict. I wanted each player to feel like they wanted to do one thing, but couldn't, because doing that thing would put them at risk for being eliminated from the game. For example, Death Race, you want to run to the finish line, but you don't want to run too fast because you would get shot. Same thing with picking up a coin, makes a ding sound. Same thing with the ninjas walking over a statue makes a sound. So I really wanted to put each player, and I wasn't sure why I did this. But I just felt like it was a cool thing to do. Put each player in a place where they wanted to do one thing or the other but they couldn't really do both.
To sort of expand on what I was saying, I think conflict. Putting a player in a state of conflict builds tension. And then, when that tension builds and builds and builds and then is released that is exciting. That's fun. That's pleasurable. And I think that's what drama and art is about in terms of literature or anything. There has to be some sort of a conflict and there has to be sort of resolution and that's sort of what drives the whole dramatic art.
And I think I stumbled upon that hidden in plain sight. And I've watched people as they play Death Race. They're very quiet, they're focused on the screen. And you can just feel the tension building. The music's building. They don't know who's gonna win. And then somebody takes a shot, and then everybody breaks for the finish line. And you can see the smiles erupt on everybody's faces and everybody starts laughing. And so there's this real tight feedback Loop of creating conflict, creating tension, releasing that tension, and then starting it all over again. I've spent many sleepless months lying awake, analyzing what is fun and what makes something fun. Why is something fun? That's how I came to this whole conflict tension resolution loop. It's certainly not an original thought, but I think that's fun. I think the build up of tension and then the release of that tension creates pleasure. I don't know why, or the science behind it, but taking apart these things is super fun and what it's all about. How did I find the music? My game was made with a zero dollar budget. You know, like I said, this is not a business so I just tried to pull together as many free assets and art and sounds as I could. Music actually, a friend of mine from high school, her husband is a musician. She had contacted me and said, hey do you know any openings and like, she wanted to get into video game music, and I said no I don't. But I kept them as a contact in the back of my head and at some point I wrote to him and said hey, I'm in this game. Are you interested in doing music for it? I said, I probably wouldn't be able to pay you. But if you just wanted to throw something together to have in a game just to say that you've done it, you could do that. And he said, well I don't have time to give you any original music. But here's my library of 15 gigabytes of music or something that you can look through. And so he let me pick or choose whatever he had already pre-written to use for the game. He was very generous to let me use that and he's in the credits for the game. And I actually have made it worth his, made the generosity worthwhile by giving him a little gift because of that. I've gotten feedback from players. I'll get an email, or a tweet that says, you know I played this game with my two sons, and we spent three hours laughing with tears rolling down our faces because we were laughing so hard, and we're punching each other in the arm. And stuff like that is really really really cool. You know it really makes me feel good. And I didn't do this to try and make money. And I haven't made money, a whole lot of money, from it. But knowing that I've had an impact on people's lives, knowing that I've helped build relationships between people, is more rewarding than I ever would've thought. >> Thanks so much, Adam. >> Thanks Adam. >> Thanks, bye. >> Talk to you later. >> Bye.

Now it's time for this week's assignment. Let's put together a game that can use another character, either a second human player or some sort of non-player character. You can try to incorporate something like this into your current project, or you can create a totally new game using all the things we've learned so far. Here's two approaches you might try. Can you expand your current game into a two player game? Is it something that two people can take turns playing? Is it something that two people can play at the same time? Can they play cooperatively against a common challenge? Would it be more fun if they played against each other? This can be something as simple as changing a space that used to say move ahead one space to other player moves ahead one space or other player moves back to the start or other players are sent to Mars. Try it out. Can you add a second player that could be automatically controlled like an NPC? Can an NPC be added to your game? It could be something as simple as a character that won't let your players pass until they roll a three or answer a riddle. It could be a wolf that automatically moves one space ahead each turn, always chasing your players through a snowy world. Remember that an NPC can add to your environment and they can also add challenges to your game. So that's all for this week and this class. Good luck with your assignments. It's been really fun for me to put together these lessons, and, of course, I'm looking forward to seeing what you all come up with. [MUSIC]
